# Face Mask Detection using CNN and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on face mask datasets. It integrates OpenCV for face detection and runs directly in Google Colab.

## 🚀 Overview

With increasing awareness of health and safety, automated systems to detect face mask usage have become essential. This project classifies faces as **"With Mask"** or **"Without Mask"** using a CNN model trained on a labeled dataset and performs real-time detection with OpenCV.

## 🧠 Features

- Image classification using a CNN
- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades
- Face mask classification using trained model
- Google Colab-compatible, no local setup required

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📂 Files

- `FaceMaskDetection.ipynb`: Main notebook with training and real-time detection
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## 📊 Dataset

Used the [Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset) containing images of people with and without masks. The dataset is loaded from Google Drive for training and testing.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Mount your Google Drive (dataset path must be updated if needed).
3. Run all cells step-by-step to train the model and perform detection.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Webcam access in Colab may not be supported. Real-time detection code is provided but works best locally or with a Jupyter environment.

## 📈 Results

- Trained CNN model achieves high accuracy on test images.
- Successfully classifies masked and unmasked faces in real time.
